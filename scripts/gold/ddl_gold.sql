Purpose
===============================================================================
This script creates the views for the Gold layer of the data warehouse.

The script performs the following actions:
    - Drops existing Gold views if they already exist.
    - Creates dimension views for Customers and Products.
    - Creates a fact view for Sales.
    - Integrates and enriches data from the Silver layer.
    - Generates surrogate keys for dimension tables.
    - Organizes the data into a Star Schema for analytical reporting.

The Gold layer represents the business-ready data model of the data warehouse.
It contains dimension and fact views that are optimized for reporting,
dashboarding, and business intelligence tools such as Power BI.

WARNING:
Running this script will drop and recreate the existing Gold views. Since
these are views and not physical tables, no underlying data in the Silver
layer will be deleted or modified.
